# Creating an Application Password in WordPress Hosting Pro

Application passwords allow you to securely connect third-party applications (like email clients, CRMs, or external APIs) to your WordPress site without sharing your main admin login credentials.  

Since Vendasta's WordPress Hosting Pro uses enhanced security parameters, you may need to install a custom plugin to enable the **Application Passwords** feature.

---

## Why Use Application Passwords?

- Prevents exposing your main WordPress password  
- Provides fine-grained access for external tools  
- Can be revoked anytime without changing your primary credentials  
- Improves security by isolating integrations  

---

## Step 1: Install the Custom Plugin

Application passwords may not be enabled by default on your Vendasta-hosted WordPress site.  
To enable them:

1. Download the plugin stub here:  
   [ðŸ“¥ Download Application Passwords Plugin Stub](./attachments/application-passwords-stub.zip)

2. Go to your WordPress dashboard.  
   - Navigate to **Plugins â†’ Add New â†’ Upload Plugin**.  
   - Upload the `.zip` file.  
   - Click **Install Now**, then **Activate**.

:::note
This lightweight plugin enables WordPressâ€™s built-in application password functionality if your hosting setup restricts it by default.

## Step 2: Generate an Application Password

4. Enter a descriptive name for your new password (e.g., *CRM Integration*).  
5. Click **Add New Application Password**.  

   WordPress will generate a **24-character password**.

6. Copy this password and store it securely.  
   - Youâ€™ll use it when connecting external apps.  
   - Treat it like a real password (donâ€™t share it publicly).  

---

## Step 3: Use the Application Password

- Paste the application password in your third-party tool (instead of your WordPress login).  
- Each integration can have its own unique application password.  
- If an integration is compromised, simply **revoke the password** in your WordPress profile.  

---

## Step 4: Manage & Revoke Passwords

You can view and manage all active application passwords under the same **Application Passwords** section in your profile.  

To revoke a password:  
- Click **Revoke** next to the entry.  
- The connected app will immediately lose access.  

---

## Security Best Practices

- Use a **unique password** for each application.  
- Revoke unused passwords regularly.  
- Always store passwords in a secure password manager.  
- Enable **two-factor authentication** on your WordPress account for added protection.
