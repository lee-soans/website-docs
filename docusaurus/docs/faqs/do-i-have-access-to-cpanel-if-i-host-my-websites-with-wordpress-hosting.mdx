**No.** [cPanel](https://cpanel.net/) is essentially a separate web hosting solution, which is not compatible with WordPress Hosting architecture.

Standard server administration processes, such as domain/certificate management, backup, restore, etc., are fully managed in WordPress Hosting. Users who have more technical experiences may also access site databases/files directly through phpMyAdmin/SFTP on our platform.
