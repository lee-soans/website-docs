Due to the nature of the shared server environment in WordPress Hosting, it is not feasible to install applications that require Admin access. Such installations are typically limited to servers with root access, such as VPS servers or Dedicated servers.

In WordPress Hosting, we won't be able to access SSH (Secure Socket Shell) and installing any Custom Applications would need SSH access to deploy the application.
