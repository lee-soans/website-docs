**Unfortunately, no.**

Since WordPress Hosting is hosted on shared server, customization of server directives for the site in WordPress Hosting especially for any one particular site is not supported. As the changes would get deployed globally.
Also, WordPress Hosting is built using NGINX, therefore .htaccess files (which are an apache directive) will not work or have any effect. 

In summary, any server-side modifications causing server-wide changes would not be supported.

If you would like to know more about NGINX or Apache, here is an [article](https://www.nginx.com/faq/what-is-nginx-how-different-is-it-from-e-g-apache/) for more information.
