## Question

Is WordPress Hosting HIPAA or GDPR compliant?

## Answer

**Not at the moment.** For GDPR we can add functions like cookie consent but full control of the data is beyond the website's control.

A requirement of GDPR is the ability for a person's data to be deleted upon request and since form fill submissions go through more than just the backend of a website, we are not able to guarantee compliance.
