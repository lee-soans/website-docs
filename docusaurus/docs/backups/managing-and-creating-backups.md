## How Backups Work: Automated vs. Manual

### Manual On-Demand Backups  fleksibel

For moments when you need an immediate backup‚Äîlike right before a major update or theme change‚Äîyou can generate a backup at any time. This gives you an extra layer of control and ensures you always have a recent recovery point.

## Important Note: Staging vs. Live Site Backups

It is critical to understand the difference in how backups are handled for your live (production) and staging sites.

### How to Back Up Your Staging Site

To back up your staging environment, navigate to the **Backups** tab, switch to the **Staging** view, and click **Create new backup for staging**.
