# How Do Contacts Generate from WordPress Hosting?

Contacts are generated from WordPress Hosting any time you send an email from the site. WordPress Hosting extracts all addresses in the *To*, *From*, *Reply-To*, *Cc*, and *Bcc* fields. These end up in the *Contact List* in the Business App and are shared with Customer Voice (if applicable).  

In Customer Voice, the Customers table will reflect the origin of the customer. If the customer is created from WordPress Hosting, the Customers' table will show that. 

Contacts can also be generated from Plugins, which will store all the details in the database of the server. 

Example: **Forminator Plugin.**
