# User Management

## What is User Management?

User Management in WordPress Hosting allows you to control who can access your WordPress site and what level of permissions they have. The system integrates with Business Center to provide secure authentication and streamlined user creation, ensuring that only authorized users can access your WordPress dashboard.

## Why is User Management important?

User Management provides enhanced security and control over your WordPress site by:

- **Secure Authentication**: Protects your site from password attacks through integrated login mechanisms
- **Unified Access Control**: Connects WordPress Hosting with Business Center for centralized user management
- **Role-Based Permissions**: Allows you to control what users can do within your WordPress site
- **Simplified User Creation**: Automatically creates WordPress users when Business Center users are added

## What's Included with User Management?

WordPress Hosting's User Management system includes:

- **Automatic User Creation**: WordPress users are automatically created when Business Center users access the dashboard
- **Secure Login Integration**: Custom login mechanisms that intercept and secure WordPress dashboard access
- **Role Management**: Ability to assign and change user roles within WordPress
- **Email-Based User Identification**: Users are identified by their email addresses across both systems

## How to Create New WordPress Users

To create WordPress users using WordPress Hosting, you must create a Business Center user first. A WordPress user will be automatically created when they access the dashboard.

1. Create a Business Center user with the desired email address
2. The user can then access the WordPress dashboard via WordPress Hosting
3. When they first log in, a WordPress user will be automatically created with Administrator role
4. The WordPress user will use the same email address as the Business Center user

:::info
All users created through Business Center will be assigned the Administrator role in WordPress by default. You can change their role after creation if needed.
:::

## How to Manage Existing WordPress Users

If you have existing WordPress users from a site import, you have two options to maintain their access:

### Option 1: Replace Existing Users
1. Delete all existing WordPress users
2. Create Business Center users for each person who needs site access
3. When they access the WordPress Dashboard, new WordPress users with Administrator access will be created

### Option 2: Match Existing Users
1. Create Business Center users for each existing WordPress user
2. Use the **exact same email address** for both the Business Center user and the existing WordPress user
3. This allows existing users to maintain their current roles and settings

:::warning
Email addresses must match exactly between Business Center and WordPress users. If the emails don't match, duplicate WordPress users will be created.
:::

## How to Change User Roles

You can change WordPress user roles using two methods:

### Method 1: Create User First, Then Change Role
1. Create a Business Center user
2. Have that user log in to WordPress through WordPress Hosting
3. In the WordPress dashboard, navigate to **Users > Role**
4. Change the user's role as needed

### Method 2: Pre-configure WordPress User
1. Create a WordPress user within WordPress using the same email you'll use for the Business Center user
2. Set the desired role for that WordPress user
3. Navigate to **Users > Role** to make changes
4. Create the Business Center user with the matching email address

## WordPress Dashboard Access

WordPress Hosting provides secure access to the WordPress Admin Dashboard through a custom integration system:

- Click the "WordPress Dashboard" button on the Overview page for secure login
- The system intercepts authentication attempts and directs unauthorized traffic away
- Valid Business Center users automatically get WordPress access when clicking the dashboard button
- New WordPress users are created automatically to match Business Center users

:::warning
Avoid plugins that interfere with login processes, such as "Rename wp-login.php". These plugins can make the WordPress Dashboard inaccessible and should be disabled before importing sites.
