# Email Plugins and WordPress Hosting

Website Standard and Pro uses *SendGrid* which delivers your transactional and marketing *emails* through the world's largest cloud-based *email* delivery platform. Based on your preferences you can either use the inbuilt mail system or can opt for another external email system based on the plugin setup.

The external SMTP plugin, WP Mail SMTP should work fine on our hosting. In case you were to use these plugins, you need to disable the WordPress Hosting's inbuilt sendgrid mail system.

**Steps to follow**: Navigate to **Wordpress Dashboard > Settings > General > Disable WordPress Hosting Mail System >** Save changes once done.

This option needs to be disabled only when you want to use your own email delivery system.
